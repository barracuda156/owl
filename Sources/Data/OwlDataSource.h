// Something that keeps a reference to a data source.
//
// A data source can conceptually die at any moment, but the object
// can only be deallocated once all the references to it are gone.
// To make this work, data sources notify the interested parties of their
// death, asking them to drop their reference. Once they all do, the data
// source gets deallocated.
//
// In addition to implementing -releaseDataSource:, data source holders
// should call -addHolder: and -removeHolder: as appropriate, to help the
// data source maintain an up-to-date list of its holders.
